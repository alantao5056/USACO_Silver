I finished everything, but thought simply that the result is
all the number of cows in the group multiplied. 

I got the wrong answer for everything but the first one, and started debugging my code
this took so long, and I still didn't find the error

Finally I realized that the error was that it wasn't the number of cows in the group
muiltiplied, but the sum of every number of cows in the group multiplied with every other one. 

This shows that you shouldn't do the problem before knowing the full problem and how you'll solve it
